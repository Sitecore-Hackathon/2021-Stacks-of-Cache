## Description

  This module was created to give content authors an easy way to get a visual representation of a structure in Sitecore.  The initial release also includes some publishing features related to if an item has been published or not.  The tool is available to run in multiple ways and involves selecting a parent item to pass into PowerShell to crawl the tree for descendants.  This is returned to the user as a visual UML graph as large or small as the size of the tree selected.

 Often while working through content migrations and daily updates it is beneficial to have a graphical view of the tree someone is working with.  This tool allows a content editor to go as high up or as low level as they'd like to get a top down view of the structure of any of the items within Sitecore (content, page assets, templates folders, etc.)
This UML diagram solution also gives the content editor an easy to recognize shading for items that haven't yet been published from master to web so they have confidence in what is deployed and what isn't. (edited)
